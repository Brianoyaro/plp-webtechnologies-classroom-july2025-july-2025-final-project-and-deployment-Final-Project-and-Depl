HOME
----

when i turn on darkmode, the footer dark and text is white but lightmode make the footer white and color white[impedes visibility] and this is not right logically.

In the next to find ou dream home, browse properties is visible but contact an agent isn't visible. also, toggling between dark and light mode does nothing to this section.

The find your dream home filter section isn't well displayed on laptops; it is squezed on one half of the screen.

PROPERTIES
------
The filter section is still white on darkmode. It should be fixed.

On darkmode, the footer and popular searches are not visible i.e are white.

About
----
in darkmode, the footer is not visible i.e is white without text.

The browse properties and contact our team buttons should be given a margin below to space them from the footer.

In darkmode, under our mission and values, the cards are white which violates the entire aspect of darkmode as is with the card under meet our team.



*********
I need a margin top on the footer in all pages to give the footer some breathing space.

When I toggle darkmode on, the navbar picks and turns dark but when I scroll throuh t he page, it turns white.

I also added images in the images/. Place each image where it ought to be.

The buttons are slighly larer on mobile devices.
